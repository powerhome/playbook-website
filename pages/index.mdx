# Playbook

**Playbook** is Power's design system built for both Rails & React interfaces. Playbook takes a modern design approach, and applies it in a way that makes it easy to support bleeding edge, or legacy systems. Playbook is built & maintained by the User Experience & Development teams at Power Home Remodeling, the largest home remodeler in the US.
It supports Rails and React components, automatically generated [sidebar and anchor links](/get-started#sidebar-and-anchor-links), file-system based routing, built-in syntax highlighting, image optimization, custom layouts, i18n, and all the features you love about Next.js.
